* zsh-git-prompt-lisp
A common-lisp implementation of [[https://github.com/olivierverdier/zsh-git-prompt][zsh-git-prompt]].

This isn't faster, or better by pretty much any metric than the original. (It
migh tbe faster than the python implementation?). In any case this was mostly
for fun and practice, and to see if I could. I welcome any suggestions for
improvement.

*Note:* I tried to use no external packages in this implementation. You can take
a look at the ~cl-ppcre~ branch for an implementation with regular expressions
that is /much/ nicer in my opinion, if a bit slower.

If you really want, you can install with [[http://www.xach.com/lisp/buildapp/][buildapp]]:

#+begin_src sh
buildapp --load /path/to/git-status-zsh.lisp --entry main --output /path/to/git_super_status
#+end_src

In theory, you should be able to download the prebuilt executable from the
release, though I haven't really tested it other than on my own computer.
