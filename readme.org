* git-status.lisp
A common-lisp implementation of [[https://github.com/olivierverdier/zsh-git-prompt][zsh-git-prompt]].

This isn't faster, or better by pretty much any metric than the original. This
was mostly for fun, and to see if I could. I had a bit of experience with emacs
lisp and a couple days with Common Lisp when writing this, so I welcome any
suggestions for improvement.

If you really want, you can install with [[http://www.xach.com/lisp/buildapp/][buildapp]]:
#+begin_src sh
buildapp --load /path/to/git-status.lisp --entry main --output /path/to/git_super_status
#+end_src

In theory, you should be able to download the prebuilt from this gist, though I
haven't really tested it other than on my own computer.
